      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>
My name is Sam Wauters. I'm a student at AP University Antwerpen.

In my work, I focus on presenting information clearly and logically. Whether it's digital projects, texts, or document structures, I strive to make complex content clear and accessible to the user.

This portfolio showcases my projects and my development as a student. It provides insight into my way of thinking, working, and improving, with attention to detail and a critical eye for quality and user experience.
